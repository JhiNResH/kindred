## 💡 Steve's Recommendations

### For Demo Video
Focus on these unique selling points:
1. **Stake-to-review** (vs Yelp's free spam)
2. **Vote-as-prediction** (upvote = bet money)
3. **ERC-404 reviews** (reviews are tradable assets!)
4. **Multi-category** (DeFi → Restaurants → Everything)
5. **x402 unlock** (pay-to-read premium content)

### For Submission
Emphasize:
- **Novel smart contract patterns** (Pay-to-Comment NFT)
- **Agentic commerce** (AI agents can use our API)
- **USDC integration** (for x402 payments)

## 🔧 Technical Notes for Future Work

### Issues Found (Non-Critical)
- Dev server had multiple instances running (cleaned up)
- GitHub tokens expire ~1 hour (need refresh before push)

### Post-Hackathon Backlog
- Uniswap v4 Hook integration (P3)
- ReputationOracle implementation (P3)
- Real USDC integration testing (current: testnet only)
