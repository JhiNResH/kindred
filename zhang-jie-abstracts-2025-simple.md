## 1. Single-cell sequencing reveals tumor microenvironment features associated with the response to neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy in oral squamous cell carcinoma

**PMID: 40105941 | Cancer Immunol Immunother | 2025 Mar**

**Objectives:** In recent years, immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown promise as neoadjuvant therapies in the treatment of locally advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). However, the factors affecting the tumor response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) remain unclear. This study aimed to analyze the impact of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (NACI) on the tumor microenvironment of OSCC via single-cell RNA sequencing, with the goal of optimizing treatment strategies.

**Methods:** We analyzed biopsy, primary tumor, matched metastatic lymph node, and normal lymph node samples from four patients with OSCC receiving two cycles of tislelizumab (200 mg), albumin-bound paclitaxel (260 mg/m2), and cisplatin (60-75 mg/m2), with 3-week intervals between each cycle. This study explored the tumor microenvironment characteristics of tumors and metastatic lymph nodes in response to NACI.

**Results:** We identified two major tumor cell subpopulations (C9 and C11), and patients with high expression of C11 subgroup-specific genes had a lower survival rate. FOXP3+ CD4 eTreg cells were found to potentially suppress the immune response. We found that NACI enhances antitumor immunity by promoting the proliferation of granzyme-expressing CD8+ T effector cells while simultaneously diminishing the effect of CD4+ T cells on Treg-mediated immune suppression. Furthermore, NACI was effective in suppressing inflammatory processes mediated by myeloid cells in tumors, contributing to its antitumor effects. The CCL19+ fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC) subgroup was significantly associated with the efficacy of NACI in patients with OSCC. We found that CCL19+ FRCs primarily exert their antitumor effects through interactions with CD8+ T lymphocytes via the CXCL12‒CXCR4 axis.

**Conclusion:** We explored the immune landscape of primary OSCC tumors and metastatic lymph nodes in relation to clinical response to NACI. Our findings offer valuable insights into patient treatment responses and highlight potential new therapeutic targets for the future management of OSCC.

## 2. Neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy brings superior quality of life of patients with locally advanced oral or oropharyngeal cancer: A propensity score-matched analysis

**PMID: 40015212 | Oral Oncol | 2025 Mar**

**Background:** The outcomes and quality of life of patients with locally advanced oral or oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LAOOPSCC) following upfront surgery (US) are suboptimal. The optimal neoadjuvant therapy involving programmed death-1 inhibitors still remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the antitumor efficacy and quality-of-life benefits of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (NACI) and compare them with those of US for LAOOPSCC.

**Methods:** A total of 570 patients with OOPSCC who underwent surgical treatment between January 2021 and January 2023 were initially reviewed and we obtained 51 unbiased patients in each of the NACI and US groups through propensity score matching based on age, sex, clinical T and N stage. The antitumor efficacy in patients in the NACI group was evaluated with the pathological response. The postoperative quality of life, as assessed with the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Head and Neck 35, as well as disease-free survival and overall survival, were compared between the groups.

**Results:** In the NACI group, the major pathological response rate was 58.8% (30/51), and the objective response rate was 66.7% (34/51). In the NACI group, patients experienced a shorter operative time (p = 0.001) and a reduced length of hospitalization post-surgery (p = 0.041), along with less intraoperative blood loss (p < 0.001) and fewer free flap reconstructions (p < 0.001). Compared with the patients in the US group, those in the NACI group had significantly better postoperative quality of life, including the sensory function (12.7 vs. 23.0, p = 0.021), speech problems (17.3 vs. 35.1, p < 0.001), social eating (20.8 vs. 31.0, p = 0.020), social contact (19.8 vs. 36.5, p < 0.001) and feeling ill (41.2 vs. 51.6, p = 0.021). There was no significant statistical difference in OS (p = 0.825) and DFS (p = 0.473) between the two groups.

**Conclusion:** The findings demonstrate the safety and feasibility of NACI and the de-escalation surgery after NACI is worth promoting to improve patient postoperative quality of life.

## 3. Patterns of lymph node metastasis and treatment outcomes of parotid gland malignancies

**PMID: 39987446 | BMC Oral Health | 2025 Feb**

**Background:** This study aimed to characterize the pattern of cervical lymph node spread and evaluate prognostic factors and outcomes of surgery and postoperative adjuvant therapy in primary parotid carcinoma (PPC).

**Methods:** We retrospectively enrolled 136 patients with PPC. The primary outcomes were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). We used Cox hazards models to assess variables influencing survival, and chi-square tests and logistic regression models to evaluate correlations between pN+ and clinicopathological factors.

**Results:** Pathology-confirmed lymph node metastasis was detected in 60.0% and 84.1% of the patients with cT1-2 and cT3-4 tumors, respectively. The occult metastasis rate in cN0 was 55.2%. Level II metastasis was most common (93.2%), followed by level I (49.3%). Histological type, histologic grade, pT stage, and AJCC stage were significant risk factors for lymph node metastasis. One- and five-year OS were 86.0% and 49.3%, respectively (median, 60 months) and 71.6% and 34.8%, respectively, for DFS (median, 24 months). Surgery with 125I seed implant brachytherapy conferred survival benefits to patients. Predictive factors for DFS were pT stage, pN stage, histological type, histological grade, and management strategy, and for OS, pT stage, pN stage, histological type, and histological grade.

**Conclusion:** Histological high grade and advanced T classification were associated with occult lymph node metastasis. Postoperative radiotherapy (RT)/radiochemotherapy (RCT), conferred significant survival benefits in PPC. Neck dissection in patients with cN0 cancer significantly improved DFS and should be performed on those with high-grade and/or advanced T-stage tumors.

## 4. Integrated peripheral blood multi-omics profiling identifies immune signatures predictive of neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade efficacy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma

**PMID: 40544277 | J Transl Med | 2025 Jun**

**Background:** Neoadjuvant PD-1 inhibitor therapy has shown promise in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), but only a subset of patients achieves major pathological responses. Liquid biopsy, the analysis of tumor-derived biomarkers in readily accessible bodily fluids (primarily blood), offers significant advantages over traditional tissue biopsies for predicting cancer treatment outcomes. The aim of this study is to develop a predictive model for neoadjuvant PD-1 therapy response in HNSCC patients using exclusively liquid biopsy approaches—namely, peripheral blood immune profiling (CyTOF) and plasma cytokine panels (Olink).

**Methods:** In a prospective trial involving 50 HNSCC patients treated with neoadjuvant tislelizumab plus chemotherapy, peripheral blood samples were collected pre- and post-treatment. Immune cell subsets were analyzed by mass cytometry (CyTOF), and circulating protein markers were quantified via a 92-plex targeted proteomics panel (Olink). Multimodal features were integrated into a predictive model using logistic regression.

**Results:** Baseline immune profiles differed significantly between responder (RD) and non-responder (NRD): RD showed higher frequencies of CD103-CD8+ central memory T cells (Tcm, c03) and elevated plasma interleukins (IL-5, IL-13), whereas NRD had more CD28-TIGIThighcPARP-CD8+ terminally differentiated effector memory CD45RA+ T cells (Temra, c17) and higher levels of chemokines (CCL3, CCL4) and MMP7. Neoadjuvant therapy reactivated both subsets, evidenced by downregulation of PD-1 and increased expression of activation markers (e.g., CD38) and cytotoxic mediators (e.g., granzyme B and interferon γ). A multimodal predictive model incorporating CD8+T cell subsets (c03, c17) and plasma biomarkers (IL-5, MMP7) demonstrated superior predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.9219).

**Conclusions:** Integrated peripheral immune profiling enables robust, noninvasive prediction of neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade efficacy in HNSCC. The identified immune cell subsets and plasma biomarkers provide a clinically applicable framework for early response stratification and personalized immunotherapy, supporting liquid biopsy as a viable platform for clinical decision-making.

## 5. Correlation between maxillary defect and facial asymmetry

**PMID: 39870547 | Int J Oral Maxillofac Surg | 2025 Jul**

The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between maxillary defects and facial asymmetry, and to establish categories for visual perception of facial asymmetry. The facial data of 47 patients who underwent maxillary resection due to tumors were captured using stereophotogrammetry. Facial asymmetry was measured using a landmark-independent method and assessed with a Likert scale. Facial asymmetry was classified into three grades (I-III) based on visual perception. Statistically significant differences (P < 0.001) were found in the asymmetry of the suborbital, zygomatic, buccal, and superolabial areas among the different visual perception categories, and the symmetry of these areas significantly influenced the visual perception (P < 0.001). The maxillary defect magnitude significantly influenced facial asymmetry perception (P < 0.001). Substantial statistical variations (P < 0.001) in the asymmetry of four facial areas, excluding the masseteric and nasal areas, across the different classes of maxillary defect were noted. Maxillary defects significantly affect the midface soft tissue symmetry. Reconstruction should focus on sufficient soft tissue support in the zygomatic, buccal, suborbital, and superolabial areas. Corrective measures are generally unnecessary for grade I asymmetry. For grade II asymmetry, reconstruction can be decided individually. For grade III asymmetry, reconstruction is essential.

## 6. Reconstructing defects following radical parotidectomy using superficial circumflex Iliac perforator flaps

**PMID: 40050935 | BMC Oral Health | 2025 Mar**

**Background:** The restoration of tissue defects following radical parotidectomy poses significant challenges due to the complex anatomy and functional requirements of the region. The superficial circumflex iliac perforator (SCIP) flap presents several advantages, including its adjustable volume, the potential for chimerism with bone, and the ability to conceal scarring. This study was conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of SCIP flaps in reconstructing defects after radical parotidectomy.

**Methods:** This retrospective study included patients who underwent reconstruction of defects after radical parotidectomy using SCIP flaps between June 2023 and June 2024. Facial nerve reanimation was achieved through the use of cervical sensory nerve grafts. Detailed records were maintained on patient demographics, flap dimensions, pedicle length, duration of surgery, complications at the donor or recipient sites, and the survival status of the flaps.

**Results:** The study included 10 patients (4 males, 6 females) with a median age of 45.5 years. Four had T3 tumors and six had T4 tumors. Facial nerve reanimation was performed in 9 patients. Flap sizes ranged from 4 cm×8 cm to 6 cm×10 cm, and pedicle lengths from 4 cm to 9 cm. Duration of operation ranged from 210 to 450 min. Six patients underwent postoperative radiotherapy. All flaps survived without radiation-related recipient complications or donor site complications.

**Conclusion:** The use of SCIP flaps has been demonstrated to be a viable and safe option for the reconstruction of defects resulting from radical parotidectomy when combined with nerve grafting techniques.

## 7. Use of Superficial Temporal Vessels in Reconstructive Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery With Vascularized Free Flaps Among "Frozen Neck" Patients

**PMID: 41255777 | Laryngoscope Investig Otolaryngol | 2025 Nov**

**Background:** This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of using superficial temporal vessels as recipient vessels for vascularized free flap reconstruction in "frozen neck" patients following radiotherapy for head and neck cancer (HNC).

**Methods:** Between February 2022 and November 2024, 16 patients underwent vascularized free flap reconstruction by using superficial temporal vessels at Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology. Among them, anterolateral thigh flap (ALT, n = 5), radial forearm free flap (RFFF, n = 1), deep circumflex iliac artery microvascular free flap (DCIA, n = 8), and superficial iliac circumflex artery perforator flap (SCIP, n = 2) were utilized. Intraoperative vessel identification, flap survival, and postoperative complications were assessed.

**Results:** All patients attained optimal surgical outcomes. During the mean follow-up period of 9 months, all flaps survived with absence of major procedure-related morbidity.

**Conclusion:** Superficial temporal vessels offer a safe, reliable approach for vascularized free flap reconstruction in challenging "frozen neck" cases, providing an effective alternative in oral-maxillofacial reconstruction.

## 8. Reconstruction of lower lip defects with chimeric nasolabial flap with buccal artery myomucosal flap

**PMID: 39855302 | J Stomatol Oral Maxillofac Surg | 2025 Jun**

**Purpose:** This study aimed to evaluate a chimeric flap comprising a nasolabial flap and a buccal artery myomucosal flap used to reconstruct a large defect of the lower lip.

**Materials and methods:** From November 2019 to August 2022, seven patients with lower lip carcinoma underwent radical resection and reconstruction. A chimeric flap comprising a nasolabial flap and a buccal artery myomucosal flap was used to reconstruct the large defect of the lower lip. Postoperative observations included flap healing, mouth opening, and lip competence.

**Results:** Seven patients with lower lip carcinomas underwent radical resection and reconstruction. The flap survived without complications in 6 patients; 1 patient showed marginal necrosis of the skin paddle. The reconstructed lower lip had an adequate lip length and height, and its appearance was acceptable. The mouth opening ranged from 2.5 cm to 3.5 cm. All patients were able to intake oral diet in a public setting.

**Conclusions:** The chimeric flap, comprising a nasolabial flap and a buccal artery myomucosal flap, offers a method for reconstructing near-total and total defects of the lower lip.

## 9. Role of 18F-FDG PET/CT radiomics in predicting lymph node metastasis and prognosis in oral squamous cell carcinoma

**PMID: 41478255 | Radiography (Lond) | 2025 Dec**

**Introduction:** This study aimed to develop and validate 18F-FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) radiomics-based models for predicting cervical lymph node metastasis (LNM) and prognosis (overall survival [OS] and disease-free survival [DFS]) in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).

**Methods:** We retrospectively enrolled 130 patients with OSCC who underwent surgery. A total of 107 radiomics features were extracted from the primary tumor. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and random forest algorithms were applied for feature selection. Multivariable logistic regression (for LNM) and Cox regression (for OS/DFS) models integrating selected radiomics and clinical features were constructed. Model performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, concordance index (C-index), calibration curves, and decision curve.

**Results:** The LNM diagnostic model, which incorporated three radiomics features (GLCM_Correlation, GLCM_Imc1, and GLCM_JointEnergy) and two clinical features (cT and cN), achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.856 and an accuracy of 81.5%, outperforming conventional visual PET/CT assessment (accuracy = 74.6%). For prognosis, the combined radiomic-clinical models for OS and DFS yielded C-indexes of 0.716 and 0.683, respectively, both significantly higher than those of TNM stage (0.630 and 0.594). Both prognostic models successfully stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups with significant survival differences (p < 0.01).

**Conclusion:** PET/CT radiomics significantly improved the diagnostic accuracy for cervical LNM and possessed the potential as a supplementary component for the TNM staging system.

## 10. Deep learning-based auto-segmentation model for clinical target volume delineation in brachytherapy after parotid cancer surgery

**PMID: 41048621 | J Contemp Brachytherapy | 2025 Aug**

**Purpose:** Timely and accurate delineation of the clinical target volume (CTV) in brachytherapy after parotid cancer surgery plays a crucial role in tailored delivery of radiation doses. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a deep learning-based model for auto-segmentation of the CTVs in postoperative adjuvant brachytherapy for patients with parotid gland cancer, addressing the challenge of achieving consistent, high-quality CTV delineations efficiently.

**Material and methods:** Using clinical imaging data from 326 patients with parotid gland carcinoma treated at Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology between 2017 and 2023, we established a training dataset of 213 cases, a validation set of 53 cases, and a test set of 60 cases. The CTVs on the images were segmented using 3D Res-UNet, a deep learning model, and compared against manual delineations performed by experienced radiation oncologists. The performance of 3D Res-UNet was optimized through a comprehensive preprocessing and training process tailored to the dataset's characteristics.

**Results:** The deep learning model yielded a significant improvement in segmentation efficiency. The deep learning model generated initial CTV contours in 9.4 seconds of computational time. Subsequent expert review and minor adjustments required an average of 11.9 minutes, substantially shorter than the 46.7 minutes needed for fully manual delineation. Quantitative analysis showed that the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of automatic segmentation by 3D Res-UNet was 0.709, which improved to 0.924 after expert review. Qualitative evaluation by senior oncologists further affirmed the clinical acceptability of the automatically segmented CTVs.

**Conclusions:** Automatic contouring with physician review enabled high-accuracy and rapid CTV generation, reducing the overall delineation workload by more than 30 minutes. Consequently, the proposed deep-learning model functions as a useful support tool that streamlines postoperative adjuvant brachytherapy planning for parotid gland cancer and lessens the burden on radiation oncologists, thereby contributing to improved patient care.

## 11. Neoadjuvant tislelizumab plus chemotherapy in locally advanced oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma: A single-arm phase II clinical trial

**PMID: 41352160 | Oral Oncol | 2026 Jan**

**Background:** This study aimed to evaluate the antitumor effect and safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus tislelizumab (a programmed death-1 inhibitor) for the treatment of resectable locally advanced oral or oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LAOOPSCC).

**Methods:** Eligible patients with stage III-IV LAOOPSCC were treated with two cycles of tislelizumab (200 mg), albumin-bound paclitaxel (260 mg/m2), and cisplatin (60-75 mg/m2) with a three-week interval between each cycle; this treatment was followed by surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The primary endpoints were the major pathological response (MPR) rate and safety.

**Results:** Between March 2022 and June 2023, a total of 82 patients were eligible and completed two cycles of neoadjuvant therapy; 78 patients underwent imaging evaluation, and 73 underwent surgery and pathological response evaluation. Forty patients underwent de-escalation surgery for the primary tumor. Orbital floor resection was avoided in 1 patient, mandibulectomy was avoided in 5 patients, and near-total glossectomy or total glossectomy was avoided in 32 patients. An objective response rate of 67.9% and an MPR rate of 60.3% were achieved, with 34.2% of patients achieving a pathological complete response. With a median follow-up time of 24 months, the two-year overall survival rate was 84.4%, and the two-year event-free survival rate was 76.7%. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 11 patients (13.4%) during the neoadjuvant therapy.

**Conclusions:** Neoadjuvant tislelizumab plus chemotherapy for LAOOPSCC achieved a high pathological response rate and favorable survival metrics with an acceptable safety profile.

## 12. Is the use of intraoperative vasopressors associated with flap failure in head and neck free tissue transfer surgery?

**PMID: 40914291 | J Stomatol Oral Maxillofac Surg | 2025 Sep**

**Background:** Maintaining appropriate blood pressure during head and neck free tissue transfer surgery is important for both organ and flap perfusion. However, the use of vasopressors to treat intraoperative hypotension is controversial. The purpose of this prospective cohort study is to evaluate the impact of intraoperative vasopressors on the incidence of flap necrosis.

**Methods:** This prospective cohort study examined patients undergoing free tissue transfer surgery of the head and neck between January 2020 and December 2021 at Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology. Exclusion criteria included history of preoperative radiotherapy or smoking and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification IV or V. The predictor variable was intraoperative vasopressor use and patients were grouped accordingly. The outcome variable was early total flap necrosis (flap failure within 7 days of the operation or before discharge). Univariate logistic regression was used to determine potential risk factors for early flap necrosis. Multivariate regression analyses with sequential adjustment for potential confounding factors was then performed to determine whether these factors were independently associated with flap necrosis. Meanwhile, linear regression analyses were performed with patients stratified according to age and sex to explore the relationship between risk factors and flap outcome.

**Results:** A total of 239 participants were enrolled, with 121 in the vasopressor group and 118 in the no vasopressor group. Age, ASA classification, Charlson comorbidity index, and flap ischemia duration significantly differed between the groups. Although vasopressor use (odds ratio [OR], 1.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39-7.07; P = 0.499) was not significantly associated with flap necrosis in univariate analysis, operation duration (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01-1.01; P = 0.001) and flap ischemia duration (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.03; P = 0.006) were. The smooth curve fitting results demonstrated that both operation duration and flap ischemia duration had a positive linear correlation with flap necrosis.

**Conclusions:** Use of intraoperative vasopressors during free flap transfer surgery of the head and neck was not associated with early flap failure.

## 13. Magnetic resonance neurography: Preoperative assessment of facial nerve invasion in malignant parotid gland tumors

**PMID: 40220868 | J Stomatol Oral Maxillofac Surg | 2025 Oct**

**Backgrounds:** Facial nerve invasion (FNI) in parotid gland malignancies significantly impacts treatment outcomes and prognosis. Accurate preoperative assessment of FNI is crucial for surgical planning and tumor staging. Conventional imaging modalities often fail to visualize the facial nerve and assess FNI.

**Objects:** This study aims to evaluate the predictive efficacy of magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) in detecting FNI in parotid gland malignancies, with the goal of aiding tumor staging and treatment decision-making.

**Methods:** 28 patients with parotid gland malignancies were included. MRN was utilized to visualize the intraparotid facial nerve and determine its relationship with the tumor. MRN results were then used to predict FNI and re-evaluate the clinical T stage. Surgical records were used for validation. Statistical analysis was performed using chi-square tests and net reclassification improvement (NRI).

**Results:** The display rates of the main trunk and other divisions (temporofacial and cervicofacial) of the intraparotid facial nerve were 100%, 96.4%, and 96.4%, respectively. Twenty-three patients (82.1%) matched the surgical findings (P < 0.01). MRN-indicated infiltration performed better than facial paralysis in predicting FNI. Tumors of stage T4a were underestimated in 22.7% of cases (n = 5), and evaluation of clinical T stage with MRN was superior to that without MRN (NRI > 0, Z = 2.17, P = 0.03).

**Conclusions:** MRN can provide valuable information for predicting FNI in parotid gland malignancies, thereby improving tumor staging and aiding treatment decision-making.

## 14. Progressive functional training in patients who underwent jaw defect reconstruction using vascularized iliac flaps: A randomized controlled trial

**PMID: 39754999 | Oral Oncol | 2025 Feb**

**Objective:** This trial was aimed at investigating the effects of progressive functional training on hip mobility, lower-limb stability, quality of life, and hip complications in patients who have undergone jaw defect reconstruction using vascularized iliac flaps.

**Methods:** Patients who underwent reconstruction surgery with vascularized iliac flaps were randomly divided into control and training groups. The control group, according to routine nursing practice, only received activity and safety guidance after the operation. The training group received progressive functional training for functional exercise. The primary outcomes were donor area function-Harris hip score and the timed "Up and Go" test. Secondary outcomes were patients' quality of life, the hip visual analog scale, and other complications. Observations and evaluations were performed before the surgery and on postoperative day 7 and at months 1, 3, 6, and 12.

**Results:** The donor area function and quality of life of the patients in the training group were significantly improved at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery, and the differences were statistically significant. The load-dependent pain in the training group was significantly reduced compared with that in the control group. The incidence rates of gait disturbance at postoperative months 3, and 6 in the training group were significantly lower than the corresponding rates in the control group (P < 0.05).

**Conclusion:** Progressive functional training can accelerate the restoration of hip function and stability of lower-limb movement, alleviate gait disorders, relieve pain, and improve patients' quality of life.
