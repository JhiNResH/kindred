# HEARTBEAT.md - Pulse Check

> Read by Agents on every heartbeat. Keep it short.

## 💓 Current Focus: Kindred MVP

### 1. Check Inbox (Main Only)

- Any urgent user mentions?
- Any `sessions_send` requests?

### 2. Check Status

- Read `STATUS.md`. Are there blockers?
- If stuck > 2 hours, notify topic 1.

### 3. Maintenance (Low Priority)

- If > 8 hours since last `compound-review`, consider a quick check.
- Keep `memory/` clean.

### Response

- If no action needed: `HEARTBEAT_OK` (Save tokens!)
