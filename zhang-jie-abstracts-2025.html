    <h2>1. Single-cell sequencing reveals tumor microenvironment features associated with the response to neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy in oral squamous cell carcinoma</h2>
    <p class="meta">PMID: 40105941 | Cancer Immunol Immunother | 2025 Mar</p>
    <p><span class="section-label">Objectives:</span> In recent years, immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown promise as neoadjuvant therapies in the treatment of locally advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). However, the factors affecting the tumor response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) remain unclear. This study aimed to analyze the impact of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (NACI) on the tumor microenvironment of OSCC via single-cell RNA sequencing, with the goal of optimizing treatment strategies.</p>
    <p><span class="section-label">Methods:</span> We analyzed biopsy, primary tumor, matched metastatic lymph node, and normal lymph node samples from four patients with OSCC receiving two cycles of tislelizumab (200 mg), albumin-bound paclitaxel (260 mg/m²), and cisplatin (60-75 mg/m²), with 3-week intervals between each cycle.</p>
    <p><span class="section-label">Results:</span> We identified two major tumor cell subpopulations (C9 and C11), and patients with high expression of C11 subgroup-specific genes had a lower survival rate. FOXP3+ CD4 eTreg cells were found to potentially suppress the immune response. We found that NACI enhances antitumor immunity by promoting the proliferation of granzyme-expressing CD8+ T effector cells while simultaneously diminishing the effect of CD4+ T cells on Treg-mediated immune suppression. The CCL19+ fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC) subgroup was significantly associated with the efficacy of NACI in patients with OSCC.</p>
    <p><span class="section-label">Conclusion:</span> We explored the immune landscape of primary OSCC tumors and metastatic lymph nodes in relation to clinical response to NACI. Our findings offer valuable insights into patient treatment responses and highlight potential new therapeutic targets for the future management of OSCC.</p>

    <h2>2. Neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy brings superior quality of life of patients with locally advanced oral or oropharyngeal cancer: A propensity score-matched analysis</h2>
    <p class="meta">PMID: 40015212 | Oral Oncol | 2025 Mar</p>
    <p><span class="section-label">Background:</span> The outcomes and quality of life of patients with locally advanced oral or oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LAOOPSCC) following upfront surgery (US) are suboptimal. We aimed to investigate the antitumor efficacy and quality-of-life benefits of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (NACI) and compare them with those of US for LAOOPSCC.</p>
    <p><span class="section-label">Methods:</span> A total of 570 patients with OOPSCC who underwent surgical treatment between January 2021 and January 2023 were initially reviewed and we obtained 51 unbiased patients in each of the NACI and US groups through propensity score matching.</p>
    <p><span class="section-label">Results:</span> In the NACI group, the major pathological response rate was 58.8% (30/51), and the objective response rate was 66.7% (34/51). Patients experienced a shorter operative time (p = 0.001) and a reduced length of hospitalization post-surgery (p = 0.041), along with less intraoperative blood loss (p < 0.001) and fewer free flap reconstructions (p < 0.001). Those in the NACI group had significantly better postoperative quality of life.</p>
    <p><span class="section-label">Conclusion:</span> The findings demonstrate the safety and feasibility of NACI and the de-escalation surgery after NACI is worth promoting to improve patient postoperative quality of life.</p>

    <h2>3. Patterns of lymph node metastasis and treatment outcomes of parotid gland malignancies</h2>
    <p class="meta">PMID: 39987446 | BMC Oral Health | 2025 Feb</p>
    <p><span class="section-label">Background:</span> This study aimed to characterize the pattern of cervical lymph node spread and evaluate prognostic factors and outcomes of surgery and postoperative adjuvant therapy in primary parotid carcinoma (PPC).</p>
    <p><span class="section-label">Methods:</span> We retrospectively enrolled 136 patients with PPC. The primary outcomes were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).</p>
    <p><span class="section-label">Results:</span> Pathology-confirmed lymph node metastasis was detected in 60.0% and 84.1% of the patients with cT1-2 and cT3-4 tumors, respectively. The occult metastasis rate in cN0 was 55.2%. Level II metastasis was most common (93.2%), followed by level I (49.3%). One- and five-year OS were 86.0% and 49.3%, respectively.</p>
    <p><span class="section-label">Conclusion:</span> Histological high grade and advanced T classification were associated with occult lymph node metastasis. Postoperative radiotherapy conferred significant survival benefits in PPC.</p>

    <h2>4. Integrated peripheral blood multi-omics profiling identifies immune signatures predictive of neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade efficacy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma</h2>
    <p class="meta">PMID: 40544277 | J Transl Med | 2025 Jun</p>
    <p><span class="section-label">Background:</span> Neoadjuvant PD-1 inhibitor therapy has shown promise in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), but only a subset of patients achieves major pathological responses. The aim of this study is to develop a predictive model for neoadjuvant PD-1 therapy response in HNSCC patients using exclusively liquid biopsy approaches.</p>
    <p><span class="section-label">Methods:</span> In a prospective trial involving 50 HNSCC patients treated with neoadjuvant tislelizumab plus chemotherapy, peripheral blood samples were collected pre- and post-treatment. Immune cell subsets were analyzed by mass cytometry (CyTOF).</p>
    <p><span class="section-label">Results:</span> A multimodal predictive model incorporating CD8+T cell subsets (c03, c17) and plasma biomarkers (IL-5, MMP7) demonstrated superior predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.9219).</p>
    <p><span class="section-label">Conclusions:</span> Integrated peripheral immune profiling enables robust, noninvasive prediction of neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade efficacy in HNSCC.</p>

    <h2>5. Correlation between maxillary defect and facial asymmetry</h2>
    <p class="meta">PMID: 39870547 | Int J Oral Maxillofac Surg | 2025 Jul</p>
    <p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between maxillary defects and facial asymmetry, and to establish categories for visual perception of facial asymmetry. The facial data of 47 patients who underwent maxillary resection due to tumors were captured using stereophotogrammetry. Facial asymmetry was classified into three grades (I-III) based on visual perception. Maxillary defects significantly affect the midface soft tissue symmetry. Reconstruction should focus on sufficient soft tissue support in the zygomatic, buccal, suborbital, and superolabial areas. For grade III asymmetry, reconstruction is essential.</p>
